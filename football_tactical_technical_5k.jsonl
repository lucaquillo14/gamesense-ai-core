{"instruction": "How can a goalkeeper improve third-man combinations during the counter-press phase in a 3-5-2?", "response": "Play up-back-through once the press commits.

{"instruction": "How can a centre-back improve defending half-spaces during the defensive block phase in a 4-2-3-1?", "response": "Show play outside; protect the central lane. Inside midfielder screens the 10; fullback tucks in when the ball is central. Distances 10–12 m laterally; step as the pass travels. Train in 5v5+2 protection games."}
{"instruction": "How can a 10 improve switch of play during the defensive block phase in a 4-2-3-1?", "response": "Switch when the far-side fullback is free and the block is narrow. Use diagonal switches, not flat passes—target the far fullback into the wide lane. Pre-scan; hit with driven pace. Coach with 6v6+2 where a switch scores double."}
